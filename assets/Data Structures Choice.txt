1. defaultdict with set for event_intersections:

- event_intersections is a dictionary where each event key points to a set of intersections it appears in on a single day.


    -   defaultdict(set) allows automatic initialization of empty sets when a new key is 
        encountered, making it ideal for this use case as it avoids explicitly checking for the 
        existence of a key before adding to it.

    -   Set as values is chosen to prevent duplicate intersections for an event, as only unique 
        intersections are needed. Adding elements to a set is average O(1), ensuring efficiency.

2. defaultdict with int for event_days_count:

- event_days_count keeps track of the number of days each event appears in multiple intersections.


    -   defaultdict(int) provides a counter structure, initializing integer values to zero by 
        default, which makes it easy to increment without checking if the key exists.

    - The integer counters allow simple addition operations, maintaining an average O(1) time complexity per update.

3. set for critical_events:

- critical_events is a set to collect events that meet the critical threshold 
(appearing on multiple days in multiple intersections).


    -   Set structure is chosen because it automatically manages unique entries without 
        duplicates, which is essential since events shouldn’t be counted multiple times once 
        they are identified as critical.

    -   Membership checks and additions in a set are average O(1), which helps keep the operation efficient.
        Lists (List[Tuple[str, str]] and List[List[Tuple[str, str]]]):

4. Lists (List[Tuple[str, str]] and List[List[Tuple[str, str]]]):

- days_list represents multiple days of events with each day's events as a list of 
  tuples, and each tuple includes an intersection and an event.


    -   Lists provide a simple and direct way to hold ordered data without needing to enforce 
        uniqueness. They are convenient to iterate over and have an O(1) access time for elements, making them suitable for this structure, especially since we’re 
        iterating over each day and its events sequentially.

    -   Lists of tuples allow compact storage and make the relationship between intersection 
        and event straightforward to process.
