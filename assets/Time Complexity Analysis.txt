Time Complexity Analysis

1. is_valid_days_list
The is_valid_days_list function validates that days_list is a non-empty list of lists containing tuples, 
where each tuple has exactly two non-empty strings.

- Checking if days_list is empty:

    - The check if not days_list: is O(1).

- Outer Loop (over days_list):
    - The function iterates over each day in days_list, which has D days. This loop runs D times.

- Inner Loop (over each entry in day):

    - For each day, it iterates over each entry, which contains an (intersection, event) tuple. 
    Let E represent the average number of entries per day.

    - This loop executes E times for each day, leading to a total of O(D×E) iterations across all days.

- Validation of each entry:

    - Each entry check, including checking the tuple type, length, and that each element is a non-empty string, takes O(1).

Therefore, the time complexity of is_valid_days_list is:O(D×E)

2. update_event_intersections
The update_event_intersections function creates a dictionary (event_intersections) where each event maps to a set of intersections 
it appears in for a given day.

- Loop over each entry in day:

    - The function iterates over each (intersection, event) pair in day.
    - This loop runs E times for the given day.

- Insertion into event_intersections:
    - For each event, adding an intersection to a set takes O(1) on average, making the entire loop O(E).

Thus, the time complexity of update_event_intersections is:O(E)

3. update_event_days_count
The update_event_days_count function updates the count of days each event appears in multiple intersections and adds critical events to 
the critical_events set if they meet a specific threshold.

- Loop over event_intersections:
    - The function iterates over each event and its set of intersections in event_intersections.
    - Since there are at most E events per day, this loop is O(E).

- Condition Checks and Updates:
    - Checking if intersections has at least two entries, incrementing event_days_count, and potentially adding an event to critical_events 
    each take O(1) on average.

Thus, the time complexity of update_event_days_count is:O(E)

4. find_critical_events
The find_critical_events function uses is_valid_days_list, update_event_intersections, and update_event_days_count 
to find critical events across multiple days.

- Validation of days_list:

    - is_valid_days_list(days_list) runs with complexity O(D×E).

- Outer Loop (over days_list):

    - The main loop iterates over each day in days_list, which runs D times.

- Processing Each Day:

    - For each day, it calls update_event_intersections (with complexity O(E)) and update_event_days_count (with complexity O(E)), resulting in 
      O(E)+O(E)=O(E) for each day.

Thus, the total time complexity of find_critical_events, including the validation step, is: O(D×E)+O(D×E)=O(D×E)


Summary of Overall Complexity
The total time complexity for the find_critical_events function, accounting for all helper functions, is:O(D×E)

where:
- D is the number of days in days_list.
- E is the average number of events per day.
